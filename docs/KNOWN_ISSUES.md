# Known Issues and Limitations

## Current Known Issues

### Pagination Performance with Large Offsets

**Issue:** Pagination using `OFFSET` becomes slower with very large offset values (10,000+ rows).

**Impact:** 
- Jumping to page 100+ in a million-row table is slow
- Performance degrades linearly with page number

**Workaround:** Use filtering or search to reduce result set.

**Priority:** Low

**Status:** Known PostgreSQL limitation - would require cursor-based pagination

### No Cross-Database Queries

**Issue:** Cannot query or compare data across multiple databases in the same connection.

**Impact:** 
- Must manually copy data between databases
- Cannot join tables from different databases

**Workaround:** Use multiple connections and manual comparison.

**Priority:** Low

**Status:** PostgreSQL architectural limitation

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality

1. **Improve Type Safety in Message Passing** ✅ COMPLETED
   - **Status:** Implemented
   - **Changes:** Created discriminated union types for webview messages (`WebviewToExtensionMessage` and `ExtensionToWebviewMessage`) in `src/types.ts`. Added type guards (`isWebviewToExtension()`) to safely validate messages. All webview communication is now fully typed.
   - **Impact:** Type safety improved from `any` types to discriminated unions. Type errors caught at compile time instead of runtime.

2. **Error Boundaries in Svelte** ✅ COMPLETED
   - **Status:** Implemented
   - **Changes:** Created `ErrorBoundary.svelte` component that catches uncaught JavaScript errors and unhandled promise rejections. Component displays graceful error UI with recovery options ("Try Again" and "Reload Page"). Errors are reported to the extension for logging.
   - **Impact:** Webview no longer crashes on JavaScript errors. Users can recover gracefully instead of needing to restart the extension.

3. **Reduce Bundle Size**
   - Current: ~500KB+ for webview bundles
   - Goal: Code splitting, lazy loading
   - Effort: Medium


### Testing

5. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Current: ~85% backend, 0% frontend
   - Goal: >90% backend, >70% frontend
   - Effort: Large

6. **Add E2E Test Suite**
   - Current: Only unit and basic integration tests
   - Goal: Full E2E scenarios with real database
   - Effort: Large

7. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Current: No automated performance testing
   - Goal: Benchmark suite for regressions
   - Effort: Medium

### Documentation

8. **API Documentation**
   - Current: Inline comments only
   - Goal: Generated API docs
   - Effort: Small

9. **Video Tutorials**
   - Current: Text documentation only
   - Goal: Video walkthroughs for common tasks
   - Effort: Medium

10. **Architecture Diagrams**
    - Current: Text descriptions in copilot-instructions.md
    - Goal: Visual architecture diagrams
    - Effort: Small
