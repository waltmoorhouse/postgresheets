# Phase 1 Completion Notes â€“ Svelte Migration Scaffold

## Tooling & Build Pipeline

- Added a dedicated `webview/` workspace powered by Vite + Svelte 4 with TypeScript support. The build emits static assets to `media/data-editor/` consumed by the extension.
- Root `package.json` now orchestrates `npm run build:webview` (invoked automatically during `vscode:prepublish`) alongside helper scripts for development (`dev:webview`, `check:webview`).
- Included base `index.html`, Vite configuration, and shared TypeScript helpers to streamline further component work.

## Data Editor Webview

- Replaced string-concatenated HTML with a Svelte `App.svelte` implementation providing:
  - Escaped cell rendering for text/JSON values, eliminating quote-related layout corruption.
  - Checkbox, text, and JSON editor controls bound to typed row state with change tracking.
  - CRUD actions (add row, delete selected, execute, SQL preview) routed through VS Code message passing.
  - Pagination, search, and batch-mode toggle parity with prior behavior.
  - Modernized GitLens-inspired styling with consistent theming, hover states, and feedback panels.
- Added JSON modal editing, modified row highlighting, and restore actions for soft-deleted rows.

## Extension Host Integration

- `DataEditor` now sends structured table payloads to the webview, handles delta updates via `postMessage`, and quotes identifiers when querying PostgreSQL.
- Connection activity is reused for pagination/search; CSP hardened to load bundled assets.
- Search results reuse accurate column metadata and primary keys to keep grid features consistent.

## Build Artifacts & Next Steps

- Initial assets generated (`media/data-editor/main.js`, `main.css`, `index.html`). Future webview enhancements should flow through the Svelte project.
- Outstanding enhancements (column resizing, filtering, schema designer) will build on the new Svelte scaffold in subsequent phases.
- Moderate vulnerabilities reported by `npm install` in the webview workspace stem from transitive dependencies; evaluate upgrades or remediation during QA phase.
